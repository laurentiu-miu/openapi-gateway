# Central Swagger in Spring Cloud Gateway.

If you have microservice architecture and you are using a spring cloud gateway structure, central swagger will be good documentation for you.
Instead of creating a swagger document URL for each of your services, we will create a structure where you can show all your services documents in a single URL.
